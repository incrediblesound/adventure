# Adventure

This is a simple variation on Dungeons and Dragons I made for my four year old daughter.

## Tips for Gameplay
The game requires a coin for d2 and a regular six sided die for d6. The DM can find a fun coin 
or toy to use for the d2, the tactile element of rolling dice and flipping coins is a big part
of the game for younger players. I also use coins for the player's health so that they can see
their life going down when their character is injured. You should also find a toy or token that
your kid likes to use for their player on the map, you can teach them how to move it around on
the map to make the game progress.

Small children won't necessarily know how to role-play when put on the spot, so you might have to
guide them, give them a lot of hints, or tell them what to do. Ultimately kids like stories so
making the game as much about storytelling as possible works well. It might not be good for 
children who are easily scared, but kids that like thrilling and scary stories should enjoy it.
