# The Mermaid's Crystal Ball

## Introduction

You are on a ship travelling to the kingdom of Lunavale, you have been travelling for days and you are excited because you should be arriving in just one more day. Suddenly, your ship stops in the water! There is wind, but your boat doesn’t move. Just as everyone comes out onto the deck to see what is the matter, five mermaids rise out of the sea. What do you do?

Ultimately the mermaids inform the player that they stopped their ship because they need help. There is an evil mermaid who stole the magic crystal ball of the mermaid kingdom. The evil mermaid took the crystal ball into their cave, and they can’t get it back because there are electric eels guarding the cave. If the adventurers would help the mermaids get the ball back, they will give them a reward.

The DM should wait for the players to ask the mermaids how to get to the cave, or help them think of this problem. The mermaids will explain that they can make an air bubble around the players and guide them to the cave, but the players must enter on their own.

## The Cave

The mermaids take you by the hand and pull you far down below the surface of the ocean. Eventually you get to a rocky ledge with a dark cave entrance in the side. The mermaids now give the player a magical torch that they can use to light up the cave, and explain that they will wait on the outside for the play to come out.

Magic item: ever-bright torch. Provides light whenever the player needs it without ever burning out.

**ROOM #1**   
The cave entrance widens out into a small room. An electric eel rushes towards you and attacks!

Monster:  electric eel x 1

**ROOM #2**   
This room has a thick patch of black seaweed growing in it. If the players search the seaweed, first two electric eels come out. If they look again, they will find the crystal ball. 


Monster: electric eel x 2
Magic item: Mermaid’s crystal ball


**ROOM #3**   
In this room the player will find the evil mermaid, he is protected by a large sawtooth eel. If the players kill the eel the evil mermaid will appear afraid. Then the player decides what to do. If the players didn’t find the crystal ball in the seaweed in room two, the evil mermaid will tell them it’s there so long as they demand it from him. If the players kill the evil mermaid then nothing happens. Nice players should probably make the evil mermaid apologize for stealing the ball.

Monster: Sawtooth eel x 1, evil mermaid x 1

**ROOM #4**   
Here the cave ends in a secret exit that leads out to the open ocean. There is a necklace lying in the sand at the exit.

Quest item: lost necklace (or something else of DMs invention)

## End
If the players find the crystal ball and bring it back to the mermaids, the mermaids will thank them and reward them with 10 gold pieces. Then they will bring them back to their ship and let them sail on.
