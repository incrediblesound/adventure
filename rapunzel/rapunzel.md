If the player talks with the people in the tavern, they tell the story of rapunzel, a princess who was trapped in a tower long ago and has never been able to escape. They suggest that maybe the adventurer can help her.

## Rapunzel’s Tower
On the road to Rapunzel’s tower, the player encounters a giant owl who attacks them.

Life: 4   
Weapon: claw 1d2 damage   
XP: 2   

When they reach Rapunzel’s tower, they have to call to her to get her to come to the window. If they say they want to help her, she says that the only thing that can help her is a magic mirror: if a person is good on the inside, they will look beautiful in the mirror, if they are bad or evil, they will look ugly in the mirror. She needs this mirror to trick the evil witch into letting her go. She then tells the adventurers that the mirror is owned by a troll who guards the gate to the northern forests.

## Troll Gate
To get to the troll gate the players have to take a road between the mountains and the forest. As they are walking this road, a mountain lion comes down out of the mountains and attacks.

_Mountain Lion_   
Defense: 2   
Life: 3   
Weapon: claw 1d3 damage   
XP: 2   
Special attribute: super fast +1 initiative   

When the players get to the troll gate, of course they have to answer a riddle before the troll will let them come in. You can use any riddle, but if you don’t have one prepared you can use:

Q: I follow you all the time and copy your every move, but you can’t touch me or catch me. What am I?   
A: Your shadow.

When they get inside, the players should know to ask for the mirror. There is only one thing the trolls will trade for the mirror: a bushel of five apples from the red mountain apple grove.

## Red Mountain Apple Grove
The red mountain apple grove is reached via a road through the mountains just south of the troll gate. The road to the grove should be uneventful, but when the players arrive in the grove, they meet the “keepers of the grove”, who reveal that the apples are 1 gold apiece. If the players don’t have enough gold for the apples, the keepers inform them that there are gold pieces lost in the wolf caves in the mountains.

The DM can make up a scary story about entering and exploring the cave, then two wolves attack:

_Wolf_   
Defense: 2   
Life: 2   
Weapon: bite 1d2 damage   
XP: 1   
If the players search the cave they find 5 gold pieces.

## Return to Rapunzel
Now that the players have the apples, they can return to the troll to get the mirror and then finally bring the mirror to Rapunzel. Rapunzel will give them a letter she wrote to deliver to her parents in Sand’s Edge. If the players still have significant life left, the DM can introduce any one of the preceding encounters or select from any number or combination of the below:

_Roc_   
Defense: 2   
Life: 5   
Weapon: Claw 1d2 damage   
XP: 2   

_Poison Snake_   
Defense: 1   
Life: 2   
Weapon: Bite 1d6 damage   
XP: 3   

_Bandits_   
Defense: 2   
Life: 4   
Weapon: Dagger 1d2 damage   
XP: 4 GP: 2   

The DM can invent a reward that the player receives from Rapunzel according to what the player might like, or use one of these:

Magic weapon: wand of lightning: 3 charges, 1d6 damage   
Magic weapon: wand of ice: 3 charges, 1d2 damage + freezes enemy for 1 hour  
Magic item: slippers of the wind +1 intiative
